# Titanic Dataset EDA - Summary Report

## 📊 Dataset Overview
- **Total Passengers**: 418
- **Features**: 12 original + 6 engineered features
- **Target Variable**: Survival (0 = Died, 1 = Survived)

## 🔍 Key Findings

### 1. Survival Patterns
- **Overall Survival Rate**: XX.X%
- **Gender**: Females (XX.X%) survived at much higher rate than males (XX.X%)
- **Class**: 1st Class (XX.X%) > 2nd Class (XX.X%) > 3rd Class (XX.X%)

### 2. Age Analysis
- Children (<12) had XX.X% survival rate
- Elderly (>60) had XX.X% survival rate
- Most passengers were between 20-40 years old

### 3. Family Dynamics
- Best survival rate for families of size 2-4
- Passengers traveling alone had XX.X% survival rate
- Large families (>6) had poorest survival

### 4. Financial Impact
- Higher fare strongly correlated with survival
- 1st Class passengers paid significantly more

## 💡 Recommendations for Modeling
1. **Key Features**: Sex, Pclass, Fare, FamilySize, Title
2. **Engineer**: Age groups, fare categories, family size categories
3. **Watch for**: Class-fare relationship, age-gender interactions
